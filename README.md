## About

This project focuses on managing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which is the total expected value from a customer throughout their relationship with the company. CLV helps optimize marketing strategies, resource allocation, and customer retention to enhance profitability.

The primary goal is to build a machine learning model to predict Customer Lifetime Value. This model aims to identify the factors influencing CLV and provide accurate predictions to support better decision-making and resource allocation. The main challenge is to develop an effective predictive model that can accurately forecast CLV and avoid errors in resource management.

The analysis process is as follows:

1. **Business Understanding**: Comprehension of business goals and needs to ensure that the implemented solutions are relevant and valuable.
2. **Data Understanding**: The process of collecting, exploring, and analyzing data to understand its quality, structure, and patterns before conducting further analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Methods for analyzing and understanding patterns, trends, and relationships in data through visualization and descriptive statistics before applying models or advanced analytical techniques.
4. **Data Preparation**: The process of cleaning, organizing, and formatting data to ensure its quality and suitability before analysis or modeling.
5. **Modeling Experiment**: The process of creating, testing, and evaluating various analytical models to find the best solution for handling data and achieving business objectives.
6. **Conclution & Recommendation**: The final section of the analysis that summarizes key findings and provides practical recommendations based on the analysis results to support decision-making.
